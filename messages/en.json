Ethereum retained these primitives and the blockchain database but created more general utility by allowing users to include Turing complete code in their transactions. That code would then be executed in a virtual machine, thereby allowing for decentralized applications (dApps).",
      "p2": "Prior to developing Koinos we were the core developers of Steem (the first fee-less and social blockchain) up until a hostile takeover and exchange attack. After leaving that project, our goal was to build a company that would empower developers to build dApps like Steem and Hive, but on a truly decentralized and fee-less blockchain that would resist the exchange attack. Unfortunately, none of the existing blockchains had the properties we needed. The \"fee-less\" blockchains were not truly fee-less, requiring that users pay for RAM and/or accounts nor were they truly decentralized as a result of their launch (ICOs) or their consensus algorithm, and often both.",
      "p3": "We wanted to take blockchain accessibility to the extreme by enabling, for the first time, free-to-use dApps which would require not only fee-less transactions, but free accounts, free smart contract execution, and network resource delegation. Delivering these capabilities required building an entirely new blockchain from the ground up and executing a provably fair decentralized launch. The end result would be a general purpose blockchain that was not just another Ethereum competitor, but the first genuine alternative to Ethereum."

The max supply of mineable tokens was 100 million KOIN. When Koinos mainnet goes live, token balances will be initialized using a snapshot of the KOIN ERC-20 and the initial target rate of new token creation will be 2%, but this can be altered in-band by governance (see the Fork-Less Upgradeability and Decentralized Governance sections). The burn component of the consensus algorithm could result in a much lower actual inflation rate and even temporary periods of deflation.",
        "p2": "As a result of the novel \"Mana\" system (see the Mana section) the mainnet tokens can be transferred without paying any fee because the Mana contained within them allows the holder to use the network without spending any KOIN.

Mainnet solves this problem through its use of the Koinos blockchain framework which allows any behavior to be added to the blockchain as a smart contract. The fundamental assumption of this framework is that any smart contract can be upgraded by an authorized party. In the case of system logic, the system governance contract has the authority to make a \"user smart contract\" into a \"system smart contract\" in-band (no hard fork) that overrides some basic, native implementation. In this way, upgrades to the blockchain's business logic can be pushed to the p2p network much like an operating system patch with minimal network disruption.",

The blockchain (i.e. the chain microservice) features natively implemented system calls that contain only the cryptographic functions necessary for constructing a technically true blockchain along with logic for dispatching a node between the native system calls and newer system calls implemented as smart contracts (i.e. WASM implementations) running in the virtual machine. This combination of native implementations and \"system smart contracts\" form a high-performance, vertically scalable, and upgradeable blockchain \"kernel\" (the framework) that allows for any behavior to be added to the blockchain without requiring a hard fork."

Koinos dramatically expands that creative space once again by allowing developers to work in all of the most used Turing complete programming languages, starting with C++ and TypeScript (using AssemblyScript), but with more languages to come. Koinos accomplishes this through the combination of three open source technologies built and maintained by the best teams in the world, all of which have ever-increasing language support. They are: (1) WebAssembly, (2) Protocol Buffers, and (3) the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol.",

The Mana system is how we accomplish those objectives. We call it \"Mana\" because the user experience replicates that of the RPG video games so many people are already familiar with.",
      "p2": "The basic premise of the Mana system is that every KOIN token is \"born\" with 1 Mana which can be consumed when a user consumes network resources. Mana is a property of the KOIN token, it is not a token itself. It therefore cannot be bought or sold and cannot acquire its own price distinct from the KOIN token. Users can, however, delegate their Mana to other users, thereby allowing non-token holders to begin using the blockchain while still effectively mitigating spam. That Mana is still tethered to the delegator's KOIN to ensure the economic sustainability of the system and maximize liquidity for the delegator who can undelegate at-will."

        "p1": "Once any of the Mana in a given token is consumed, that token is locked for 5 days, so they can develop a weekly \"rhythm\"to their blockchain (and dApp) usage. This creates an opportunity cost in lieu of a real-time monetary cost that serves to disincentivize the submission of value-less transactions. This fixed period of time functions as a \"regen time\" which creates the user experience of Mana \"regenerating over time,\" creating a fun, almost game-like user experience.",
        "p2": "The regen time is based on how long it takes for one satoshi of Mana to regenerate, with regeneration happening on all of a user's tokens at the same time.

Each transaction must explicitly specify an address of a payer for the transaction, and optionally a payee. The payer's Mana is spent and the payee's account nonce is updated. If there is no payee set, the payer is used for both. The combination of these features allows a smart contract to specify a payer for its Mana costs.",

With the Mana resource model, the resources are tracked separately to maximize efficiency, but the user is still only charged in Mana. Resources are pooled every block, with a limit to how many of those resources can be consumed per block and an XYK market maker is used to set a price for each of the resources in a given block.",
      "p2": "This multi-dimensionality allows developers to optimize their contracts to target underutilized network resources. End-users will prefer those dApps which perform such optimizations because they will get more \"bang for their Mana,\" creating a positive feedback loop of decentralized self-regulation. This system would gradually and continuously charge users more Mana as they consume more contentious resources and less Mana for consuming underutilized resources. The end result is a simple, efficient, and dynamic system for determining resource costs based on user behavior that guarantees the lowest possible cost, while ensuring that the network is protected. The Mana charged is simply the linear combination of each resource and cost (e.g. `bandwidth_cost * bandwidth_used + storage_cost * storage_used + compute_cost * compute_used`)."

Proof-of-burn enables us to accomplish provable egalitarianism by delivering the economics of proof-of-work with even higher efficiency than proof-of-stake.

Like proof-of-work it requires that the cost of attacking the network be paid \"up front.\" Like proof-of-stake, no actual hardware has to be purchased and run, aside from the hardware required to produce blocks. Like proof-of-work the exchange attack is thwarted because the block producer has already lost their money, they are simply trying to get it back by maintaining a correct ledger. Any exchange seeking to leverage user funds to influence governance as a result of greed, coercion, or deception (see the <link>Steem/Tron incident</link>) would first have to destroy user funds, which they would never do. This also reduces the need for the complicated slashing conditions required for proof-of-stake implementations because block producers are effectively \"pre-slashing\" their capital prior to earning block rewards, as with proof-of-work."

The blockchain distributes \"virtual hash power\" fungible tokens (VHP) to the block producer which can be used to mine a block without needing to run expensive hardware. As the block producer mines blocks, their virtual hash power (VHP) diminishes over time, requiring them to burn more to continue producing. In this way, burning tokens is equivalent to buying mining hardware which degrades over time and the electricity required to perform proof-of-work."

When an account with VHP receives units of KOIN as a block reward, their VHP balance is reduced by that many units. In this way VHP acts as a proxy for KOIN and the total supply of VHP and KOIN can be summed to establish the \"virtual token supply\" for the purpose of setting a maximum rate of new token creation. To ensure that there is always incentive to produce blocks there must be a net positive rate of new token creation. Initially, the target rate of new token creation on mainnet will be 2%."

      "title": "Deflation",
      "p1": "As a result of the burn component, the total token supply can be either increasing (inflation) or decreasing (deflation) depending on the level of competition for block production. If the demand for block rewards is increasing linearly, then at a certain point the rate at which KOIN is being burned will outpace the rate at which new KOIN is being produced. The result would be a decreasing token supply despite the new token creation (i.e. \"deflation\")."

    "randomness": {
      "title": "Randomness",
      "p1": "Proof-of-burn keeps the core consensus mechanism of proof-of-work, but exchanges energy for time by using a <link>verifiable random function (VRF)</link>. Every block will contain quanta (sometimes called \"slots\"), milliseconds in length, which block producers will compete to produce on. In order to earn back their burn, the block producer must attempt to produce on every quantum. This attempt will involve the block producer using their private key, a timestamp, and the previous random output of the VRF to generate a hash which is then divided by their VHP (i.e. their burn). If the hash is low enough, then they produce (similar to proof-of-work), otherwise they have to try again on the next quantum."

      "title": "Efficiency & Consistency",
      "p1": "The block producer's incentive is not to perform as much work as possible, but to perform as little work as is necessary to attempt to produce on every quantum. From here, proof-of-burn behaves the same as proof-of-work except that the block producer only has to hash once per quantum. Because block producers are competing to produce on one of the many quantum inside a block, the end result is continuous block production. Dividing the hash by the size of the producer's burn guarantees that the dominant factor in selecting a block producer is the size of their burn and not the amount of computational work they have performed (which will be practically nothing) thereby delivering on the promise of high efficiency."

    "miningPools": {
      "title": "Mining Pools",
      "p1": "Unlike on proof-of-work chains, mining pools on Koinos can increase decentralization and participation in governance as they could empower non-technical users to allocate their capital to more technical users who can guarantee more uptime and vote in accordance with the desires of their contributors.

Like every system behavior, governance is \"just\" another smart contract on Koinos, albeit one with system level privileges and special importance in the upgrade process. The governance contract is modeled off of how the Bitcoin network manages upgrades (e.g. SegWit) and can be thought of as the world's simplest Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). It allows people to: (1) Propose upgrades, (2) Review upgrades during a \"review period,\" (3) Cast votes on upgrades during a \"vote period\" and (4) at the end of the vote period, the proposal must pass or fail. Votes are cast by producing a block so influence over governance is based on how many tokens a user has burned, not how much they hold (stake).",
      "p2": "Application of the upgrade is delayed 1 week to ensure developers and businesses have time to adapt their systems to the upgrade. To prevent the spamming of proposals, users must burn KOIN whenever they submit a proposal. In order to ensure this fee can be calculated in a decentralized and autonomous manner, the burn fee is equal to the total supply divided by 1,000,000. Since all actions on the blockchain must also pay a fee in Mana, the \"resource credit limit\" for submitting a proposal is 1/10th of the burn fee, or 10 Mana in the previous example."

    "upgradingGovernance": {
      "title": "Upgrading Governance",
      "p1": "Since the governance system is itself a Koinos smart contract, all of these parameters can be changed without a hard fork. In fact, this is what ultimately distinguishes Koinos as the only blockchain truly capable of evolution; governance can upgrade itself! But as the most important component of the system, it should be much harder to change governance than any other part of the system. For that reason, a 75% supermajority vote is required for governance upgrades, while only a 60% majority is required for non-governance system upgrades (system call overrides and system contract promotions). But again, even these numbers can be modified by governance (with a 75% majority)."

    "conclusion": {
      "title": "Conclusion",
      "p1": "In this document we have outlined the innovative business logic added to the Koinos blockchain framework to make Koinos mainnet the most accessible blockchain in the world. The Mana system allows for more efficient use of network resources while creating the frictionless (even fun) user experiences to which people have become accustomed. Mana delegations allow non-token holders to use dApps without having to acquire tokens, completing the Web2 user experience on a decentralized platform. The KOIN token allows mainnet to launch fully decentralized as a result of its open and fair proof-of-work launch on Ethereum. On mainnet, the KOIN token will regulate free usage of the entire Koinos ecosystem, inflating and deflating appropriately through the proof-of-burn consensus algorithm, while decentralized governance pushes continuous improvements through fork-less upgrades developed using the Universal Language Support."

    "a1": "To accelerate the transition to a truly decentralized future by providing Web2 User Experiences on Web3.",
    "q2": "When will mainnet be released?",
    "a2": "Main net was released on November the 5th, 2022 and fully decentralized December 5th, 2022.",
    "q3": "How will mainnet tokens be distributed?",
    "a3": "The initial token balances on main net were determined entirely by the token balances of the KOIN ERC20 (i.e. the KOIN tokens on Ethereum that were distributed through proof of work mining). That ERC20 was implemented using OpenZeppelin’s tooling including their snapshot mechanism. This mechanism within the smart contract allows for the creation of a decentralized record of all token balances and total supply at the time of use (i.e. a “snapshot”). No date has been announced for the snapshot that will be used for mainnet.",
    "q4": "How is Koinos feeless?",
    "a4": "Koinos features a new concept called “mana” that is the most innovative solution to the halting problem since the invention of Ethereum’s “gas.” It is a property of the KOIN token that gets “consumed” as a user performs feeless transactions, but that also regenerates over time. This means that even if all of a user’s mana gets consumed, all they have to do is wait if they want to perform more feeless transactions without having to purchase additional KOIN. Once any mana in a token is consumed, that token becomes locked (non-transferrable) for the duration of the regen period. The regen period is based on how long it takes for one satoshi of mana to regenerate, with regeneration happening on all of a user's tokens at the same time. Since this mechanism is distributive, the regen time appears dynamic to the user. In other words, a user's mana will constantly be regenerating so they will not have to wait the full 5 days to resume their blockchain usage.",
    "q5": "How decentralized is Koinos?",
    "a5": "Koinos is highly decentralized as a result of its novel proof-of-burn consensus algorithm. the KOIN token is intended to deliver on Satoshi’s original vision of a truly peer-to-peer electronic cash that utilizes spare computational resources and does not require dedicated hardware. In other words, it is provably egalitarian.

Proof-of-burn enables Koinos to accomplish provable egalitarianism by delivering the economics of proof-of-work with even higher efficiency than proof-of-stake.",
    "q6": "What is the TPS (transactions per second)?",
    "a6": "Koinos main net is capable of supporting an average TPS of 150 and a peak TPS of 450 but it is important to bear in mind that Koinos is not optimized for throughput, it is optimized for upgradeability which means that it can rapidly adopt the most advanced and secure scaling solutions (e.g. sharding, parachains, etc.) as soon as they are available. Koinos Group, the inventors of Koinos have already identified new WASM VMs that could improve performance by 10x.",
    "q7": "Was there an ICO?",
    "a7": "No. The KOIN token launch was modeled off Bitcoin to maximize accessibility and made innovative use of the Ethereum blockchain to further maximize accessibility. Instead of having to access an entirely new blockchain, people could use an incredibly easy-to-use, free, and open mining program to submit CPU-optimized proofs of work to an Ethereum smart contract which would in turn distribute KOIN tokens based on the size of the proofs.The purpose of this Ethereum-based token is to pre-seed the Koinos ecosystem with a base level of decentralization. This means that the only way to acquire KOIN was through PoW mining or open market purchases so there was no pre-mine, ICO, IEO, or any other IxO (lol).",
    "q8": "What are the features of mainnet?",
    "a8": "1. Feeless Mana system <br> 2. Proof-of-Burn consensus algorithm <br> 3. Universal Language Support <br> 4. Infinite Upgradeability",
    "q9": "Is Koinos “Ethereum-compatible”?",
    "a9": "Maximum accessibility is the ultimate compatibility. Koinos is designed so that developers can use the programming languages they already know and love to build their applications, not learn new languages like Solidity. Any developer who can write a smart contract in Solidity can easily rewrite that smart contract in C++ or TypeScript, which are the first two languages Koinos will support.",
    "q10": "How is the team funded?",
    "a10": "Koinos Group is being modeled off traditional tech growth companies that sacrifice profits in the early years to build a user base and leverage unique knowledge of an ecosystem to find product-market fit for a high-margin software product. Koinos Group was founded by the core development team behind the Steem blockchain to accelerate the transition to a more decentralized future by focusing on accessibility. This team worked together for 4+ years at Steemit on the Steem blockchain, at the time the most accessible blockchain by orders of magnitude, and we have now been working together for nearly 2 years on Koinos. Every member of Koinos Group has been working solely for equity in the company, which means they believe in the product and the business plan, and have a vested interest in seeing both the platform and the company succeed. Koinos Group had to acquire its KOIN like everyone else through either PoW mining or open market purchases, making it impossible to confuse holding KOIN as any kind of investment in Koinos Group. This aligns its incentives with the incentives of the Koinos community.",
    "q11": "How will Koinos scale?",
    "a11": "The ultimate scaling solution is the ability to rapidly integrate the most efficient, secure, and well-maintained scaling solutions as they emerge. In other words, upgradeability is the ultimate scaling solution which is why Koinos is designed to be the most upgradeable blockchain in the world. Whether the best solutions leverage inter-chain communication, sharding, or something else entirely, Koinos will be ready to take advantage of any or all of these.",
    "q12": "How Composable is Koinos?",
    "a12": "Koinos has the highest degree of composability possible because it is the only blockchain framework to move all of the system logic into smart contracts. When we’re talking about composability in the blockchain context, what we are talking about is the ability for decentralized application developers to repurpose code that is already running on the blockchain within their applications (i.e. to “compose” their applications). Most blockchains that claim “high composability” are just saying that they don’t have sharding, which is an attempt to rebrand a limitation as a value-add. Koinos is optimized for flexibility which means that it could shard, or not shard, based on the smart contracts that are running on it. Because all of the system logic is contained in smart contract modules, application developers will be able to not just repurpose the smart contracts written by other dApp developers, they’ll be able to repurpose the code written by the most experienced blockchain engineers in the world; the engineers building Koinos-based blockchains. But wait there’s more! Because these smart contracts will be written in an ever growing number of the most used programming languages in the world, developers won’t just be able to find the perfect smart contract for their needs, they will be able to find smart contracts written in their preferred programming language! This takes the composability of Koinos, already far greater than any other protocol, to an entirely new level! Follow us on Twitter for updates and the latest AMA location."
